DevOps Final Project Requirements 
Project Overview 
Enhance the mid-term project by integrating advanced DevOps technologies and practices learned during the 
course. 
Duration: 2 weeks 
Team Size: Individual or pairs 
Complexity: Intermediate 
 
Technical Requirements 
 
1. Application Enhancement 
● • Upgrade the Python application based on mid-term feedback 
● • Implement file-based data persistence (instead of RAM only) 
● • Containerize the application and push to Docker Hub 
● • Application must launch with initial dummy data 
 
2. Infrastructure as Code 
Use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure: 
● • 3 EC2 instances 
● • Load Balancer 
● • Required networking components 
 
3. Configuration Management 
Use Ansible to configure: 
● • Kubernetes cluster on the EC2 instances 
● • NFS server for persistent storage 
● • Any additional components required for proper system operation 
Note: This list covers the main requirements. Students are expected to identify and implement any additional 
components needed for a fully functional system. 
 
4. Kubernetes Deployment 
● • Deploy application using Helm charts 
● • Configure port forwarding and NFS access 
● • Ensure high availability across nodes 
 
5. CI/CD Pipeline 
● • Implement GitHub Actions workflow that starts with running tests, then includes: 
○   ○ Building and pushing the container to Docker Hub 
○   ○ Running Terraform to provision infrastructure 
○   ○ Running Ansible to configure the systems 
○   ○ Running Helm to deploy the application 
● • Entire deployment must be automated through a single CI/CD process 
● • Include basic testing in the pipeline 
● • If using GitHub Secrets for sensitive data (AWS credentials, passwords, etc.), this must be clearly 
documented in the README 
  
6. Networking Configuration 
● • Configure the infrastructure so that the Load Balancer forwards public port 80 to the appropriate 
Kubernetes cluster port 
● • Ensure end-to-end connectivity from internet to application 
 
Documentation Requirements 
Create a comprehensive README.md including: 
Essential Information 
● • Personal details (name, ID) 
● • Project title and description 
● • GitHub repository URL 
● • Complete step-by-step instructions for evaluators: 
○   ○ How to clone the latest version 
○   ○ All tools that need to be installed (with versions) 
○   ○ All configurations required for successful deployment 
○   ○ Clear instructions for triggering the CI/CD pipeline 
● • Instructions for where and how to add AWS credentials 
● • How to find the Load Balancer's public IP address 
● • Link to separate application user guide (separate .md file) 
 
Technical Documentation 
● • Prerequisites and required tools 
● • Pipeline stages description 
 
Operations Guide 
Testing: 
● • Health check procedures 
● • Test URLs and endpoints 
● • Expected outputs 
Troubleshooting: 
● • Known issues and solutions 
● • Log file locations 
● • System cleanup instructions 
 
Additional Documentation 
Application User Guide (separate .md file) with: 
● • How to use the application 
● • Available features 
● • API endpoints (if applicable) 
 
Testing & Validation 
● • Primary validation: Access the application via Load Balancer's public IP on port 80 
● • The web application should be fully functional upon first access 
● • Dummy data should be visible immediately after deployment 
  
Strong Recommendation 
Test your project thoroughly before submission: 
1. Create a new GitHub account 
2. Clone your project on a clean machine with no pre-installed tools 
3. Follow your own README instructions exactly 
4. This will help you: 
● • Verify your documentation is complete and clear 
● • Ensure the project will pass evaluation successfully 
● • Identify any missing dependencies or configurations 
 
Submission Guidelines 
● • All code must be in a GitHub repository 
● • All project files must be zipped and submitted through the Moodle system  
● • Except for AWS authentication, the entire process must run automatically 
 
Evaluation Criteria 
● • Automation completeness 
● • Code organization and documentation 
● • Successful integration of all components 
● • README clarity and completeness 
● • Application accessibility via Load Balancer (port 80) 
 
 
Good luck!  
 
Focus on creating a working solution rather than perfection.
